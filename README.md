# Employee-Attrition-Prediction
End-to-end machine learning project that predicts employee attrition using HR analytics data. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model comparison, and deployment using Streamlit.
In human resources and business contexts, attrition specifically describes employee departures from an organization, typically via resignations, retirements, or eliminations of positions without immediate replacement.
Voluntary attrition: Employees choose to leave for personal reasons, better opportunities, or retirement, which is a natural workforce transition.
Involuntary attrition: Involves forced exits like position eliminations or downsizing, though less common in the core definition.
Natural attrition: Includes retirements or deaths, allowing organizations to shrink headcount passively.
Importance of Prediction:
Prediction plays a crucial role across fields like business, science, and machine learning by enabling proactive decision-making and reducing uncertainty based on data patterns. Accurate forecasts help anticipate outcomes, optimize resources, and minimize risks.
Binary Classifictaion:
Binary classification is a fundamental supervised machine learning task where models categorize data into exactly one of two distinct classes, often labeled as 0/1, positive/negative, or true/false.
